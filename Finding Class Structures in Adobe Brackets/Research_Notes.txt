Current Research: The Noticable Similar Patterns found in both Atom's and Brackets' Editor.


Findings for Atom:
 - Line 310: Atom's editor uses an update function which has many cases of use, so perhaps
	it is an example of a Facade pattern.
 - Line 526: This "Serialize" function seems as though it utilizes the Module/
	Revealing Module pattern as it returns a DOM object that contains functionality
	as well as variables.
 - look into line 297



Findings for Brackets:
 - Line 613 in src/command/Menus.js: This may be an example of a command pattern
 -
